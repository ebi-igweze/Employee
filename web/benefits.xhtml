                                        A personal leave of absence without pay may be granted an employee at the discretion 
                                        of the company.  A personal leave of absence is defined as an absence of two weeks or 
                                        longer.  It is not our general policy to grant personal leaves of absence and such 
                                        leaves will be granted only under unusual circumstances.  A personal leave of absence 
                                        is not available instead of medical leave.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Granting of such a leave depends on the review of the merits of each case, including 
                                        the effect the employeeâ€™s absence will have on the workload of the other employees.  
                                        Probationary employees are not generally eligible for leaves of absence.  An employee 
                                        must have one year of continuous employment before such a leave will be considered.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Applications for leaves of absence may be granted or rejected as dictated by the 
                                        judgment of [name of person who approves requests].
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Salary and benefits are not payable to an employee while the employee is on a personal 
                                        leave of absence, with the exception of company-paid term life insurance that is continued 
                                        for eligible employees for one year of a leave of absence.  Health insurance may be continued 
                                        if the employee pays the full premium at the group rate.  Although employees do not accrue 
                                        benefits while on leave, those benefits accrued up to the time the employee started the leave 
                                        will be retained.
                                    </p>

                                        The employeeâ€™s exact position, tour of duty, or work area may not be guaranteed upon return 
                                        from a personal leave of absence; however, all efforts will be made to place the employee in 
                                        the first available similar job with similar pay.  The employeeâ€™s date of initial employment 
                                        will be adjusted to reflect the time spent on personal leave.
                                    </p>

                                        It is the employeeâ€™s responsibility to return to work on the date the leave of absence expires.  
                                        Should the employee fail to return and fail to notify [name of person who should receive requests] 
                                        of a request for an extension, we will assume that the employee does not intend to rejoin the company 
                                        and will consider the employee to have resigned from employment.  A request for extension of a leave 
                                        of absence must be in writing and must be received at least five working days prior to the expiration 
                                        of a leave.
                                    </p>
